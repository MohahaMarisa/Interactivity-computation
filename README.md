# Interactivity-computation
Creative coding, interactive new-media art, and computational design - specifically working with popular 
open-source arts-engineering toolkits, including p5.js (JavaScript), Processing (Java), and openFrameworks (C++),
applied to interactive art and design, information visualization, generative media, and other creative cultural practices.

(much thanks to Dan Shiffman for all his tutorial and resource code - it has helped with my projects)
